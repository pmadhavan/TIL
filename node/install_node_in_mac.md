### Download Node.js


1. If you are going to pick nvm or brew method, install [xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) from appstore first and agree to the apple license agreement. Only after this step, command line `install` command would work.

2. To download node.js in mac there are multiple ways, i used this [official package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) to install using nvm. The link provides brew and docker options too.
